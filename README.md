# Hello-World

Aim: Write a basic hello world program and a calculator program in c++

Theory: This "Hello, World!" program is to showcase the basic structure of a C++ program, including the use of headers, namespaces, the main function, and console output withÂ 'std::cout'.
We have also made a simple calculator which can add two numbers.
